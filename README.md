# SHARK ATTACKS ANALYSIS

## INTRODUCTION:
This analysis examines 821 shark attack cases across 25 countries. The Power BI dashboard identifies high-risk locations, times, and species patterns to improve beach safety strategies and public awareness.  

This project explores global shark attack data to uncover trends in victim demographics, injury patterns, and environmental factors that contribute to incidents.  

## KEY FINDINGS: 
- **Top Location**: USA (572 attacks)  
- **Most Dangerous Species**: Great White Shark (200 attacks)  
- **Peak Time**: Afternoon (53% of attacks)  
- **Common Victim Profile**: Young males (84% of cases)  

## POWER BI TOOLS USED:   
- Power Query 
- Data Modeling 
- Data Cleaning 
- Data Visualization 
- Actionable insights

## SKILLS / CONCEPTS DEMONSTRATED:  
- Power Query transformations  
- Time intelligence calculations  
- Geographic visualizations

## ANALYSIS  
### Attack Trends Over Time  
Shark attacks have increased significantly since 1900, with spikes from 1980-2000. The rise correlates with growing beach tourism and water sports popularity.  

### Geographic Hotspots  
The USA accounts for 70% of all attacks, with Florida's New Smyrna Beach being the most dangerous single location. Australia and South Africa follow as secondary hotspots.  

### Victim Demographics  
Males experience 84% of attacks, likely due to higher participation in risky water activities. Young adults (20-35) are the most affected age group.  

### Injury Patterns  
Feet and legs suffer 67% of injuries, indicating most attacks occur in shallow waters during wading or surfing.  

## RECOMMENDATIONS & CONCLUSION  
1. Launch safety campaigns in Florida, NSW, and Cape Town during peak seasons  
2. Install shark monitoring systems at high-risk beaches  
3. Educate surfers/swimmers about afternoon risks  
4. Develop protective gear for legs/feet  

The data reveals clear patterns in when, where, and to whom attacks occur. While incidents have risen, most are non-fatal. Targeted safety measures can significantly reduce risks while preserving marine ecosystems.
