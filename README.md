# SHARK ATTACKS ANALYSIS

## INTRODUCTION:
This analysis examines 821 shark attack cases across 25 countries. The Power BI dashboard identifies high-risk locations, times, and species patterns to improve beach safety strategies and public awareness.  

This project explores global shark attack data to uncover trends in victim demographics, injury patterns, and environmental factors that contribute to incidents.  

## KEY FINDINGS: 
- **Top Location**: USA (572 attacks)  
- **Most Dangerous Species**: Great White Shark (200 attacks)  
- **Peak Time**: Afternoon (53% of attacks)  
- **Common Victim Profile**: Young males (84% of cases)  

## POWER BI TOOLS USED:   
- Power Query 
- Data Modeling 
- Data Cleaning 
- Data Visualization 
- Actionable insights

## SKILLS / CONCEPTS DEMONSTRATED:  
- Power Query transformations  
- Time intelligence calculations  
- Geographic visualizations

## ANALYSIS  
## Shark Attack Trends Over Time 

Shark attacks have significantly increased since the early 1900s, with noticeable spikes from the 1980s through the early 2000s.

## Most Affected Countries & Locations 

The United States has the highest number(572) of reported shark attacks, followed by Australia, South Africa, and Brazil.

Within these countries, coastal areas such as Florida(New Smyrna Beach), New South Wales, and Cape Town report the highest concentrations.

## Injury Patterns 

Feet and legs are the most commonly injured body parts, highlighting that many attacks occur in shallow waters.

Arms and thighs follow, which could point to swimming or surfing incidents.

## Time of Day Patterns 

Shark attacks most frequently occur during the morning(33%) and afternoon(53%) hours, likely due to peak human activity and certain shark feeding patterns.

Nighttime attacks also appear significant, suggesting lower visibility as a risk factor.

## Shark Species Involved 

When excluding vague classifications like "Other," the Great White Shark is the most common species involved in attacks with a total of (200), followed by Tiger Shark (80)and Bull Shark(58).

These species are known for being aggressive and frequenting human-populated waters.

## Gender & Age Distribution 

Males are overwhelmingly more affected than females (over 80% of victims), possibly due to higher engagement in risky water activities.

The Young Adult age group reports the most attacks, followed by children and adults.

## Fatality Rate 

Roughly 14% of attacks are fatal, indicating that most victims survive — especially when prompt medical treatment is available.

## Seasonality

Shark attacks tend to rise between June and October, aligning with summer beach activity in many countries.
## RECOMMENDATION & CONCLUSION
- Public Safety Campaigns: Governments and beach authorities should launch targeted awareness programs in high-risk countries and coastal towns.

- Time-based Activity Warnings: Limit or regulate beach activity during afternoon and night hours, when attacks are more likely.

- Protect Children in Shared Access Zones: In areas with high child participation in water queues, towns should invest in safe, child-friendly infrastructure.

- Species Monitoring: Invest in marine tracking and proper logging of shark species involved in attacks to better predict and prevent incidents.

- First Aid & Medical Training: Equip lifeguards and local responders with injury-specific training — especially for lower limb injuries.

- Improve Data Quality: Consistent reporting of species, time, injury, and victim demographics is needed to support accurate insights and policy-making.

This analysis highlights how, where, when, and to whom shark attacks are happening. Although the number of attacks has risen, most are non-fatal and can be minimized through education, better infrastructure, and informed safety practices. 

By focusing efforts on high-risk locations, vulnerable groups, and key time periods, stakeholders can improve public safety while maintaining harmony with marine ecosystems.
